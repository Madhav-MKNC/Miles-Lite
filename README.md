## 📍 Real Moments. Real Panic. Real Replies.

- "Hey, I saw you staring at me during class. You're kinda cute." 
    - Dang. She noticed.  
        - *Now what? Deny it? Own it? Make her smile?*  
            - You're one message away from winning her over—or ruining the vibe.

- "Hey, what’s the status on the milestone? We need your input before we proceed."  
    - Project? Milestone? You haven’t even opened the doc.  
        - *You’ve got 2 minutes to sound composed, confident, and not get exposed.*  
            - Time to fake it like a pro (without sounding fake).

- "Soo... you like me or what? 👀"  
    - Oh. My. God. She dropped the bomb.  
        - Now the whole tone of the convo hangs on your next line.  
            - Be funny? Be flirty? Be smooth?  
                - *Say the wrong thing—game over. Say the right thing—hello late-night calls.*
